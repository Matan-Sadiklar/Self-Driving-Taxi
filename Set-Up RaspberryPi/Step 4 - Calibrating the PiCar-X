// Step 1
  cd ~/picar-x/example/calibration
  sudo python3 calibration.py

// Step 2
  // The R key is used to test if the 3 servos are working properly. 
  // After selecting a servo with the 1, 2 or 3 keys, 
  // then press the R key to test that servo.

// Step 3
  // Press the number key 1 to select the front wheel servo, 
  // and then press the W/S key to let the front wheel looks as 
  // forward as possible without skewing left and right.

// Step 4
  // Press the number key 2 to select the Pan servo, 
  // then press the W/S key to make the pan/tilt platform
  // look straight ahead and not tilt left or right.

// Step 5
  // Press the number key 3 to select the tilt servo, 
  // then press the W/S key to make the pan/tilt platform look 
  // straight ahead and not tilt up and down.

// Step 6
  // Since the wiring of the motors may be reversed during installation, 
  // you can press E to test whether the car can move forward normally. 
  // If not, use the number keys 4 and 5 to select the left and right motors, 
  // then press the Q key to calibrate the rotation direction.

// Step 7
  // When the calibration is completed, press the Spacebar to save the 
  // calibration parameters. There will be a prompt to enter y to confirm, 
  // and then press Ctrl+C to exit the program to complete the calibration.

// Step 8
  // Lay down a strip of black electrical tape, about 15cm long, 
  // on a light-colored floor. Center your PiCar-X so that it straddles the tape. 
  // In this setup, the middle sensor of the greyscale module should be 
  // directly above the tape, while the two flanking sensors should hover 
  // over the lighter surface.

// Step 9
  cd ~/picar-x/example/calibration
  sudo python3 grayscale_calibration.py

// Step 10
  // Press the “Q” key to initiate the greyscale calibration. 
  // You’ll then observe the PiCar-X make minor movements to both the left 
  // and the right. During this process, each of the three sensors should sweep 
  // across the electrical tape at least once.

  // Additionally, you will notice three pairs of significantly different 
  // values appearing in the “threshold value” section, while the “line reference” 
  // will display two intermediate values, each representing the average of 
  // one of these pairs.

// Step 11
  // Next, suspend the PiCar-X in mid-air (or position it over a cliff edge) 
  // and press the “E” key. You’ll observe that the “cliff reference” values are also 
  // updated accordingly.

// Step 12
  // Once you’ve verified that all the values are accurate, 
  // press the “space” key to save the data. You can then exit the program by 
  // pressing Ctrl+C.
