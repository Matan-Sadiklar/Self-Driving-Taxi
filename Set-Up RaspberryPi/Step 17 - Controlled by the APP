  Open and create a new controller.

  Create a new controller by clicking on the + sign in the SunFounder Controller APP.

  There are preset controllers for some products in the Preset section, which you can use as needed. 
  Here, we select PiCar-X.

  Connect to PiCar-x.

  When you click the Connect button, it will automatically search for robots nearby. 
  Its name is defined in picarx_control.py and it must be running at all times.

  Once you click on the product name, the message “Connected Successfully” 
  will appear and the product name will appear in the upper right corner.

  You need to make sure that your mobile device is connected to the same LAN as PiCar-X.
  If it doesn’t search automatically, you can also manually enter the IP to connect.

  Run this controller.

  Click the Run button to start the controller, you will see the footage of the car shooting, 
  and now you can control your PiCar-X with these widgets.

  Here are the functions of the widgets.

A: Show the current speed of the car.
E: turn on the obstacle avoidance function.
I: turn on the line following function.
J: voice recognition, press and hold this widget to start speaking, and it will show the recognized voice when you release it. We have set forward, backard, left and right 4 commands in the code to control the car.
