// So here we need to set all the servo angles to 0° and then install them, 
// so that the servo angle is in the middle, no matter which direction to turn.

// Step 1

// To ensure that the servo has been properly set to 0°, 
// first insert the servo arm into the servo shaft and then 
// gently rotate the rocker arm to a different angle. 

// This servo arm is just to allow you to clearly see that the servo is rotating.

// Step 2
  cd ~/picar-x/example
  sudo python3 servo_zeroing.py

// Step 3
  // Next, plug the servo cable into the P11 port as follows, 
  // at the same time you will see the servo arm rotate to a position
  // (This is the 0° position, which is a random location and may not be
  // vertical or parallel.).

// Step 4
  // Now, remove the servo arm, ensuring the servo wire remains connected, 
  // and do not turn off the power. Then continue the assembly following 
  // the paper instructions.
